1. Various Sources of Big Data 
   The various sources of big data are :
    -  Social Media
    -  Sensor 
    -  Search Engines 
    -  Public web 
    -  Docs 
    -  Data storage 





2. 3 V's of Big Data 
    The 3 V's of big data are 
    - VOLUME   : The amount of data present is the volume .
                 It is measured in Zettabytes , gigabytes . 

 
    - VARIETY  : It is the type of data .
                 It can be structured , unstructured or semi structured . 


    - VELOCITY : The speed in which the data is accessible is the velocity .
 




3. Horizontal Scaling and Vertical Scaling 
     
   Horizontal Scaling :  It is the ability to connect multiple hardware or software entities, so that they                                             work as a single logical unit. This kind of scale cannot be implemented at a moment’s notice.


   Vertical Scaling  :  It is the ability to increase the capacity of existing hardware or software by adding resources. 
                        The size can only get as big as the size of the server.




4. Need and working of Hadoop 

   Need of hadoop 
    - Hadoop allows us to quickly write and test the distributed system . 
    - It is efficient and automatically distributes the data and work across the machines . 
    - It detects and handles failure at application level . 
    - It is open source .      

  Working of hadoop 
   Step 1 : The user submits the job to the hadoop job client for required process . 
   Step 2 : Now , the hadoop job client now submits it to the job tracker . the job tracker distributes it to the slaves and              monitors it . 
   Step 3 : The job tracker executes the task as per map reduce and output of reduced function stores is stored in the output             of the file system  .
